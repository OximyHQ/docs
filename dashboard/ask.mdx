## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about time ranges">
    Instead of "show activity", try "show activity this week" or "activity in the last 30 days".
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Name tools explicitly">
    Instead of "which chatbot is popular", try "how much is ChatGPT used?" or "Claude vs ChatGPT usage".
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ask one thing at a time">
    Break complex questions into simpler ones. Instead of "who uses ChatGPT most and what do they use it for", ask them separately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the suggestions">
    The suggested questions are tailored to your data and show what Ask can answer well.
  </Accordion>

## Limitations

Ask works best with:
- Questions about aggregated data (counts, rankings, percentages)
- Time-based queries (this week, last month)
- Comparisons between tools, users, or devices

Ask may not handle:
- Very specific queries about individual events
- Complex conditional logic
- Questions requiring data Oximy doesn't capture

If Ask can't answer your question, it returns a text card explaining why or suggesting alternatives.
