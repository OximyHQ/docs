This guide covers how to enroll devices in your Oximy workspace, from adding a single device to deploying across teams.

## How enrollment works

Each device needs a unique **enrollment code** to connect to your workspace:

1. Generate a code in the Oximy dashboard
2. Enter the code in the sensor app on the target device
3. The device registers and appears in your dashboard

<Note>
  Enrollment codes are **6 digits**, formatted with a space for readability (e.g., `158 221`). They expire after **10 minutes**.
</Note>

## Adding a single device

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the enrollment dialog">
    In the Oximy dashboard, click **+ Add Device** in the sidebar, or go to the **Devices** page and click **Add Device**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the operating system">
    Choose **Mac** or **Windows**. For Mac, also select the chip type (Apple Silicon or Intel).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download and install">
    Download the sensor installer and follow the [installation guide](/sensor/installation).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the enrollment code">
    Copy the 6-digit code shown in the dashboard and enter it in the sensor app. The dashboard will show "Waiting for device to connect..." while it waits.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name the device">
    Once connected, you can give the device a friendly name (e.g., "Sarah's MacBook Pro") and optionally assign an owner email.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enrolling multiple devices

For team deployments, you have several options:

### Option 1: Individual enrollment

Generate a unique code for each device. Best for:
- Small teams (under 10 devices)
- When you want specific device names assigned during enrollment

### Option 2: Self-service enrollment

Share sign-up access with your team:

1. Invite team members to the Oximy dashboard
2. Each member enrolls their own device
3. Devices appear in the shared workspace automatically

<Tip>
  Self-service enrollment works well for distributed teams where IT can't physically access each device.
</Tip>

### Option 3: Pre-configured deployment

For large-scale deployments:

1. Contact Oximy support for enterprise deployment options
2. Pre-configure devices with workspace credentials
3. Automate installation via MDM or deployment scripts

## Device information

After enrollment, each device shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Device Name | User-assigned name |
| Owner | Email of the device owner |
| Operating System | macOS, Windows, or Linux |
| Status | Online or Offline |
| Last Seen | When the device last reported |
| Sensor Version | Installed sensor version |

### Updating device information

Click on any device in the **Devices** page to:
- View device details
- See activity history
- Update the device name
- Change the assigned owner

## Monitoring enrollment

### From the dashboard

The **Devices** page shows all enrolled devices with their status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Online (green) | Sensor is running and connected |
| Offline (gray) | Sensor is not running or device is off |

### During onboarding

The enrollment wizard shows real-time status:

1. **Waiting** — Code generated, waiting for device
2. **Connecting** — Device found, completing registration
3. **Success** — Device enrolled, ready to monitor

## Troubleshooting enrollment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code expired before I could enter it">
    Codes expire after 10 minutes. In the dashboard, click **Generate new token** to get a fresh code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Device stuck on 'Waiting for device to connect'">
    Check that:
    - The sensor app is running on the target device
    - The enrollment code was entered correctly
    - The device has internet connectivity
    - No firewall is blocking Oximy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Device enrolled but shows offline">
    The sensor may have been closed or the computer may be asleep. Open the Oximy app on the device to reconnect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong device name">
    Click on the device in the Devices page to edit its name.
  </Accordion>
