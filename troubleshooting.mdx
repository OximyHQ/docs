## Enrollment Issues

### Enrollment code expired

<Note>
  Codes expire after **10 minutes** for security.
</Note>

**Solution:**
1. In the dashboard, click **Generate new token**
2. Enter the new code within 10 minutes
3. Make sure your device's clock is set correctly

### Device not connecting

**Symptoms:** Dashboard shows "Waiting for device to connect..." but nothing happens.

**Check these:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Network connectivity">
    - Verify the device has internet access
    - Try a different network (corporate proxies may interfere)
    - Check that your firewall isn't blocking Oximy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code entered correctly">
    - Codes are 6 digits (e.g., `158 221`)
    - Watch for similar-looking characters (0 vs O, 1 vs l)
    - Copy-paste from the dashboard if possible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sensor app running">
    - macOS: Check for Oximy icon in menu bar
    - Windows: Check for Oximy icon in system tray
    - Try quitting and reopening the app
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Device shows offline after enrollment

**Cause:** The sensor app stopped running.

**Solution:**
- macOS: Open Oximy from Applications
- Windows: Open Oximy from Start menu
- Check if the computer went to sleep

## Detection Issues

### No activities appearing

**Symptoms:** Sensor is running but no activities show in the dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify sensor is running">
    Check for the Oximy icon in your menu bar (macOS) or system tray (Windows).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check permissions">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS">
        Go to **System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy**:
        - **Accessibility**: Oximy should be checked
        - Grant any other permissions if prompted
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        The sensor should have been granted permissions during installation. Try reinstalling if permissions were denied.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify certificate is installed">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS">
        Open **Keychain Access**, search for "Oximy CA". It should appear in your System or login keychain.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        Run `certmgr.msc`, navigate to **Trusted Root Certification Authorities → Certificates**, look for "Oximy CA".
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check proxy is enabled">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS">
        Go to **System Preferences → Network → Advanced → Proxies**. Web Proxy and Secure Web Proxy should point to `127.0.0.1`.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        Go to **Internet Options → Connections → LAN Settings**. Proxy server should be enabled with address `127.0.0.1`.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test with a supported tool">
    Try using ChatGPT, Claude, or another major AI tool. The sensor detects 60+ AI services.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Activities delayed

**Normal:** Activities typically appear within a few seconds.

**If delays exceed 30 seconds:**
- Check your internet connection
- The sensor syncs periodically; slight delays are normal
- Try manually syncing from sensor Settings (macOS)

### Wrong tool showing

**Solution:** Use the **Missing an app?** feature in the Inventory page to report detection issues. The Oximy team will investigate.

## Certificate Issues

### SSL errors in browsers

**Symptoms:** "NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID" or similar certificate warnings.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    **Verify trust settings:**
    1. Open **Keychain Access**
    2. Search for "Oximy CA"
    3. Double-click the certificate
    4. Expand **Trust** section
    5. Set "When using this certificate" to **Always Trust**

    **Reinstall if needed:**
    1. In Oximy Settings, toggle certificate off
    2. Toggle certificate on again
    3. Enter your password when prompted
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    **Check certificate store:**
    1. Run `certmgr.msc`
    2. Navigate to **Trusted Root Certification Authorities → Certificates**
    3. Verify "Oximy CA" is present

    **Reinstall with admin rights:**
    1. Run Oximy as Administrator
    2. Go to Settings → Certificate
    3. Click Uninstall, then Install
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Certificate installation failed

**macOS:**
- Ensure you have admin rights

## Proxy Issues

### Port already in use

**Symptoms:** "Port 1030 already in use" error.

**Solution:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ```bash
    # Find what's using the port
    lsof -i :1030

    # Kill if it's a stuck process
    kill -9 PID
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```cmd
    # Find what's using the port
    netstat -ano | findstr :1030

    # Kill the process
    taskkill /PID XXXX /F
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Restart Oximy — it will find the next available port automatically.

### Some apps not using proxy

Certain applications bypass system proxy settings. For CLI tools, set environment variables:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    ```bash
    export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:1030
    export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:1030
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows (CMD)">
    ```cmd
    set HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:1030
    set HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:1030
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows (PowerShell)">
    ```powershell
    $env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:1030"
    $env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:1030"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
